# Monty.py

A collection of Python programs that reference Monty Python

Similar to an awesome list, it is very much a work in progress. Please open a pull request to add more to this list.

**Syntax guide:**

- The list is in alphabetical order (A-Z)
- Each character has their own heading
- The repository name must be listed as an indented list. Documentation repositories must be sub-indented, like so:

- [`user/example`](https://www.example.com/404/Example/)
- - [`user/example_Docs`](https://www.example.com/404/Example_Docs/)

- Trailing backslashes are desired
- The name of the repository should be put into a code block: `like_so`
- If a repository is on GitHub, you should add `:octocat:` after the first bracket, and before the code block, to indicate that it is located on GitHub before someone hovers over or clicks the link.
- Don't duplicate entries, although you can list the same repository if it is on multiple sites (for example, a repository is on GitHub, but has a mirror on GitLab, vice versa, etc.)

## Its guy

- [:octocat: `seanpm2001/Its`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Its/)
- - [:octocat: `seanpm2001/Its_Docs`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Its_Docs/)

## Miss Islington

## Spam

Entry missing.

**More monty python characters must be added.**
